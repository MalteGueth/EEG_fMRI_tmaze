# EEG_fMRI_tmaze

> This repository is a collection of scripts and functions for analyzing simultaneously recorded EEG-fMRI data acquired while running an adaptation of a T-Maze task (i.e., [Baker & Holroyd, 2009][baker_holroyd]). Furthermore, we present developmental methods for correcting MR related artifacts in EEG data.

### General rational of the study

For decades, T-maze paradigms have been used extensively across several animal species (e.g. mice, rodents, ferrets, cats) to investigate
navigation and, thereby, a “real-life” goal-directed behavior. The simplicity of the T-maze paradigm belies its utility and versatility 
for examining goal-directed navigation, and such investigations have produced a wealth of information about spatial learning and memory, 
long-term reference memory, perseveration, reinforcement learning, effort-based decision making, and foraging strategies in response to 
different reinforcement contingencies. This line of research has also indicated that animals bind reinforcement experience with spatial 
context in the service of common goals, a process coordinated by multiple interacting neural systems. Yet, in humans, the interaction 
between these systems during goal-directed behavior is still poorly understood. 
Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of human electrophysiological and hemodynamic responses to reinforcement in a virtual T-maze 
paradigm, providing new evidence for this high-level integration of spatial and reinforcement information in humans. These results provide 
the spectral, temporal, and spatial architecture of goal-directed navigation in humans. 
Together, we propose that imaging humans navigating a simple virtual T-maze can be utilized as a powerful translational model by which to 
map the dynamic interaction between disparate neural systems underlying “real-life” goal-directed behavior in both health and disease.
