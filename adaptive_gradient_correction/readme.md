# Adaptive gradient correction

The functions contained in this directory were created to provide a number of adaptive correction approaches
for removing gradient artifacts from EEG signals recorded in the MRI environment. These aim to account
for head movements as well as distortions of the average artifact through ballistocardiac artifacts.

This project is pursued as an assignment for the graduate course 'Scientific Programming in Matlab' (Behavioral
and Neural Sciences Program, Rutgers University - Newark).
