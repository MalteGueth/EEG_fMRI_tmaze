# Adaptive gradient correction
> Performs a gradient artifact correction for EEG data recorded during simultaneous fMRI acquisition which can be informed by movement and heart beat parameters

The functions contained in this repository directory were created to provide a number of adaptive correction approaches
for removing gradient artifacts from EEG signals recorded in the MRI environment. These aim to account
for head movements as well as distortions of the average artifact through ballistocardiac artifacts. All of the
analyses are written for Matlab R1018b and can be performed without eeglab (see Usage example). 

The outlined analyses are adapted from the approaches presented in Allen, Josephs, & Turner (2000) as well as 
Moosmann, Schoenfelder, Specht Scheeringa, Nordby, & Hudgahl (2009). Their original functions can be found in
this _[repository][bergen_toolbox]._

This project is pursued as an assignment for the graduate course 'Scientific Programming in Matlab' (Behavioral
and Neural Sciences Program, Rutgers University Newark). Example data has been collected in the _[Baker Laboratory
for Cognitive Neuroimaging and Stimulation][lap_page]._
