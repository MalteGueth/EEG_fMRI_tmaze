### Feb. 25th - Mar. 3rd
* To enable a better insight into the structure of the research project, I uploaded a rough draft
for a readme that would guide readers through the preprocessing and analyses
  * For a start, I focused on converting prior analyses into jupyter notebooks, but only managed to finish
  the preprocessing bits. There are still some flaws to correct (i.e. no correction for eeg marker timings,
  only cluster images for first level MRI, no coordinates for peak values in functional clusters, etc)
  * Although the overall fMRI data quality for the three pilot sets seems fine, I have to do more work on
  quality control before the real recruitment. That way I can figure out the ideal preprocessing modules.
