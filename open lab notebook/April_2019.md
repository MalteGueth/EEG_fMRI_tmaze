### April 1st - April 7th
* After the starting problem from last week, all further experiments on April 1st, 3rd and 5th went according to plan. On April 4th, I invited the first subject back, so I could get her electrode positions. Granted, they were obviously in a different positon the second time I placed them on the subject. However, this might still prove to be a better estimation of positions than a standard electrode location file.

* I noticed again the variablility of electrode net fits for different subjects. Since I am mostly collecting data on psychology students and a majority of them are female, a net size of 58-61 cm likely does not perfectly fit. My attention was specifically on the mastoids, as these represent my offline reference. While the midline electrodes are easy to bring into position even on a head to small for the net, more peripheral positions like the mastoids might be too low or have insufficient contact to the slin. Hence, I will continue with a cluster of mastoid electrode postions around M1 and M2 for offline re-referencing.

* My RA and me were able to streamline the process preparing the EEG, ECG, and taking a picture using the GPS system, which eliminated the last time problems we had as soon as we went downstairs to the MRI scanner.

* Having collected the first few complete datasets, I ran a couple of quality control procedures to ensure that MRI, ECG, and EEG data were of sufficient quality.
  
  * MRI: Besides the distortions in the preiphery due to local field inhomogeneity (resulting from the presence of EEG/ECG equipment inside the MRI bore), there were no major issues with the collected functional and structural MRI data.
    * For future considerations: I noticed the precise 'electrode shaped' distortions on the head surface and had two thoughts about them. 1) Is it possible to estimate approximate electrode positions on a subject's head based on local distortions? 2) How would the local field distortions impact analyses dependent on the integrity of surface segementations (i.e. simulations of TMS electric fields)?
  * EEG: Considering the circumtstances, most datasets were of sufficient, even good quality.
  * ECG: very nice
  
* Due to the time necessary for scheduling subjects and running experiments, Travis and I postponed our weekly meetings. Instead I just informed him about the progress of the data collection.

### April 8th - April 14th
* Experiments for this week were conducted on April 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th. All of them were carried out successfully, even though the simultaneous baseline experiment suffered from frequent drop out, as a lot of participants did not show up to the experiment.

* On April 12th the subject aborted the experiment prematurely, forcing us to skip the T1 image and the end of the DTI data acquisition. Since the reasons for aborting the experiment had nothing to do with discomfort in the MR environment, we could ask the subject to return at another date.

* Regarding data quality, most datasets mirrored were on the same level as the week before, except one dataset collected on the 11th. For this case all data modalities suffered from severe movement artifacts.

* As last week, I skipped my weekly meeting with Travis to make up for the time necessary for scheduling subjects and running experiments.


### April 15th - April 21st
* Experiments for this week were conducted on April 15th (x2), 16th, and 17th. All but one were carried out successfully. On April 16th I noticed some noise in the ECG at the end of the experiment during the resting state acquisition. As a result, I ran some tests with the ECG and found an even worse error. The next day I repeated the tests with some colleagues and could not find a heart beat. However, we found that the ECG1 input at the EEG connector was loose. Consequently, I wrote an error report to EGI.

* Since we could not resolve the ECG issue, I cancelled all appointments for further experiments.
