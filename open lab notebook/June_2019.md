### June 3rd - June 9th
* Since I was largely preoccupied with analyzing and plotting data for TMS simulation grant as well as preparing a journal club paper for submission, I did not find the time to significantly advance the EEG-fMRI project

* Over the past week, I read the following papers related to this study’s purposes:
  * Functional Source Separation for EEG-fMRI Fusion: Application to Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnbot.2019.00024/full
  * A Comparative Survey on Simultaneous EEG-fMRI Methodologies: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8251257

### June 10th - June 16th
* Creating plots and analyzing data for the grant continued into this week as well, which again took time away from the EEG-fMRI analysis

* Over the past week, I read the following papers related to this study’s purposes:
  * The cognitive map in humans: Spatial navigation and beyond: https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc6028313
  * Resting-state fMRI reveals enhanced functional connectivity in spatial navigation networks after transcranial direct current stimulation: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304394015300604

### June 17th - June 23rd
* Creating plots and analyzing data for the grant continued into this week as well, which again took time away from the EEG-fMRI analysis

* I received a heads up that the MR compatible EEG nets are going to arrive at the center soon. However, Travis and I decided that due to time constraints and the upcoming expiration of the IRB protocols that we are going to delay any further data collection to focus on data analysis and advance the study progress.

* In order to replicate Travis' previous results (https://www.nature.com/articles/srep09063) I started updating the SPM and script used in that study. Furthermore, I aligning the basic preprocessing steps in my nipype script with the previous SPM script to be able to compare results better. The only steps I added from my nipype preprocessing to the SPM one is artifact detection and quality control measures.

* Over the past week, I read the following papers related to this study’s purposes:
  * The cognitive map in humans: Spatial navigation and beyond: https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc6028313
  * Resting-state fMRI reveals enhanced functional connectivity in spatial navigation networks after transcranial direct current stimulation: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304394015300604

### June 24th - June 30th
* Again, due to a friend from Germany visiting me, I did not visit work all day everyday and spend a little less time with data analysis.

* Based on the preliminary first level data, results are not as clear as in the previous study, since both spatial navigation clusters and directional clusters (left vs. right), which should show a fairly strong effect, seemed smaller and inconsistent for a list of subjects.

* I realized that part of it was due to a redundant and strong smoothing module in the script that I had overlooked while adapting the SPM script. After correcting this mistake (now single smoothing with 8mm), clusters appeared more consistent and resembled past results a lot more (lateralized effects over parietal and occipital lobe for navigating through left and right alley, hippocampal and occipital-parietal clusters for spatial navigation vs. scrmabled images).

* Over the past week, I read the following papers related to this study’s purposes:
  * Effect of Spatial Smoothing on Task fMRI ICA and Functional Connectivity: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2018.00015/full?report=reader
