### April 29th - May 5th
* I continued quality control procedures for all subjects. Overall, these made me conclude that while there are outlier subjects (i.e., due to movement), in most cases the data quality is satisfying and for now, I’ll continue analyzing everyone.

* I had to take a break from analyzing the data starting at Friday afternoon due to the upcoming finals exams as well as a long period of data collection for three other studies in the lab.

### May 6th - May 12th
* With the finals exam on Thursday, I still used most of my time for studying and running electric field simulations in order to determine coil orientations for another study running in the lab at the moment.

* After Thursday, I still worked a lot on the simulations, but also got back to this study. I devised a plan for how to handle the upcoming work load with data collection coming to an end. In order for me to able to focus on programming the analyses I want to run, I will teach my RA how to run the solutions and respective analysis workflows in brain vision analyzer.

* Over the past week, I read the following papers related to this study’s purposes:
  * Exploring the origins of EEG motion artefacts during simultaneous fMRI acquisition: Implications for motion artefact correction: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811918301319?via%3Dihub

### May 13th - May 19th
* With most of the remaining subjects for the simulation study coming in this week, I had to spend some more time on running the analyses and creating some plots for Travis and the grant he is writing.

* On Friday my RA and I had our first meeting, so I could give him an introduction to the analysis of EEG and fMRI data. Instead of focusing on his future task, I first put an emphasis on the data we had collected (i.e., what files are recorded for each subject, what format are they in, what do they represent).
 * To coordinate with multiple RAs in our lab interested in this topic, to distribute literature as well as tasks, and to discuss updates on the data collection plan, I opened a new slack channel. 

* Over the past week, I read the following papers related to this study’s purposes:
 * Imaging localized neuronal activity at fast time scales through biomechanics: https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/4/eaav3816.abstract


### May 20th - May 26th
* The meeting with my RA for this week had to be postponed due to scheduling conflicts. Hence, we agreed on a couple of meetings for the next two weeks in advance in order to speed things up.
 * To enable my RA to study on his own time and at his own pace, I posted new literature in the slack channel at different levels of proficiency with the material. Some of this literature is meant to prepare him for the concrete task I picked for him (i.e. manuals for brain vision analyzer and their solutions for EEG-fMRI as well as EGI imports).

* On Monday, I received the notification that my talk on multimodal data fusion and the data from my master thesis was accepted for the Big Questions symposium #3 on multimodal data integration at this year's annual meeting of the society for psychophysiological research (SPR). For this reason, I dedicated time during the week and at the weekend to revisit the data, my thesis, reading new literature (see reading list section) and drafting my talk. Later this week, I also was informed that my poster on the preliminary results for this study was accepted at SPR as well.

* Over the past week, I read the following papers related to this study’s purposes:
 * Best practices in data analysis and sharing in neuroimaging using MEEG: https://osf.io/a8dhx/
 * Multimodal fusion of brain imaging data: A key to finding the missing link(s) in complex mental illness: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4917230/
 * Multimodal imaging: an evaluation of univariate and multivariate methods for simultaneous EEG/fMRI: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20097029/
 
### May 27th - June 02nd
* I updated our lab homepage on several topics. One of them is a section linking to this github repository where I will reference the current state of results for this study.

* This week I met with my RA both on Thursday and Friday to continue the introduction to our data analysis.

* Over the past week, I read the following papers related to this study’s purposes:
 * Why more is better: Simultaneous modeling of EEG, fMRI, and behavioral data: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S105381191501143X?via%3Dihub
 * Software Toolkit for Fast High-Resolution TMS Modeling: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/05/20/643346.full.pdf
